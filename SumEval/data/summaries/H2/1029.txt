Parents should feel empowered when it comes to keeping their kids off drugs.
Talk to your kids, not just about drugs but in general.
Ask parents to define problems associated with drug use rather than simply focusing on drug use itself.
Keep talking with your kids about substance abuse.
Adolescents abuse prescription drugs more than just about any other substance.
Listen with love and empathy to your children.
Keep your focus on the use of drugs.
Paying attention to this will help you know how your child is feeling.
Teaching your kids to make choices is the best anyone can do.
