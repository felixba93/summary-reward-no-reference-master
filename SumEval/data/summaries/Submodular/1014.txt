It's also important to keep cigarettes where your teen won't reach them, and to not smoke where they will see you. Community members need to consider the following question: "Given the fact that the tobacco industry spends millions every year to lure teenagers into smoking, do we want to punish young people who have become addicted to tobacco or stigmatize them as 'criminals'?" Most adolescent smokers believe they will eventually quit for health reasons and because of the desire to be free from a constraining habit although they seldom have a precise idea about the best time to stop.
