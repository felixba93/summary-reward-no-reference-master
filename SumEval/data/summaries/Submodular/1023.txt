[Parent] "I am concerned with the bullying in the school and do not believe that anything is being done about it this program looks like it could be a benefit to your school as I have children that go there myself" and it took 9 months for my child to get back on the bus. . . we need to make a difference, get educated and teach our children to open up about what happens at school, learn to trust their teachers and parents to not be afraid to tell, teach parents how to approach the problem so 'we' can help the best way we can. . . " Ask if there are anti-bullying school programs you can join.
