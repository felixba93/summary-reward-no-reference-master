If you find that the main reasons you want to send your child to preschool are that he seems eager to learn new things and explore, he isn't getting enough stimulation at home or daycare, or he seems ready to broaden his social horizons and interact with other children, chances are it's the perfect time to start school. It's likely that your child's teacher will review all of this on the first day or at an orientation program, but to ease any fears your child may be having, it's a good idea to go over it before she starts. Go along, ring them up and say, "I'd like to come and have a look".
