You asked if it was the parents or the schools responsibility to teach the students on how to reduce the levels of cyber bullying either through social sites or just regular cell phone or text use. Because of technology today I think that children should start being taught about this at a very young age so that they can get used to what happens on the Internet and not be offended in the case that they start to become bullied online. Usually kids will tell their parents when cyber-bullying occurs but, if they don't and you suspect something, take the initiative to talk to them.
