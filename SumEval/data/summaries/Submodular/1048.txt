I don't believe that her holding has anything to do with the way she was brought up to use a potty, but more with the dramatic difference between her home and nursery environment (as you mention in your article). If you notice that your toddler hides behind the sofa whenever he needs to poop in his diaper, it could be a sign that your child is constipated or he experiences discomfort whenever he has a bowel movement - difficulties that could lead to stool training refusal when you start trying to toilet train him down the road. You need to accept them for what they are, accidents, and move on.
