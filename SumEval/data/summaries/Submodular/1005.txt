You may need to redirect your child physically (I had to do this all the time with my older one--I'd have to physically move him from the situation, or put my hands on his and give the toy back, or put my hands on his and brush his teeth for him while he held the toothbrush--and sometimes still do when he gets very tired) or just sit down with your kid and hug her so she calms down, or just let her rage until the fit is over. You know we've taught so many parents how to learn to discipline their children and build their self-esteem, to bless and honor their children while they're disciplining.
