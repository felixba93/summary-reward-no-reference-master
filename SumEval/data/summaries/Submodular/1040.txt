Best of luck As a special educator whose experience is in teaching students with learning disabilities, I can tell you that your son's school psychologist and a special education teacher should be able to run a battery of tests that will indicate if there is a discrepancy between your son's cognitive ability and his academic achievement. The most important aspect to be remembered is that LD has nothing to do with intelligence and it is just that the child needs to learn differently in order to keep pace with his age group in terms of reading, writing, math or comprehension.
