I'm sure you've all seen the ads that encourage parents to talk to their kids about drugs and smoking, but how do you do it? This would be a good time to ask questions of your teen to find out what kinds of things other kids their age are doing, and what temptations they have had to face. If young people see that so many of their friends don't use substances like drugs or alcohol, it will be easier for the individual teen to "just say no". He is facing and expulsiong from school and we have to meet with the board. Now as an adult I do not know how to parent my own children.
