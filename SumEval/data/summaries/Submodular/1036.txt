Now, I know that as teachers, you don't have time to incorporate individual games, hobbies or activities into your curriculum, but it's my hope that you might encourage parents to encourage their children to try activities like these---particularly activities that capture the interests of their classmates as well---providing shy children with a tool to help them break the social ice and make friends. We get the sense that when our child gets to school, learning and doing things with other kids occurs naturally, and her anxiety levels went way down from where they were at her previous school.
