Practitioners may like to read a case study of a school that set out to enhance parents' knowledge of how they could support their children with mathematics homework to give them the confidence to play a greater part in their child's education. This does not mean that traditional activities, such as parents helping in the classroom and meeting with teachers at school have no value - there may be lots of indirect benefits of such contact, and in any case, such contact can be directly geared to encouraging and supporting parents in talking with their children about their learning at home.
