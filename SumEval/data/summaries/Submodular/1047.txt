Numerous educators who have studied gifted children with learning disabilities have found that, ideally, these students should receive instruction as a special group for at least part of the day from a teacher sensitive to their specific academic, social, and psychological needs and with peers who share their dual exceptionalities (Daniels, 1983; Whitmore & Maker, 1985; Yewchuk, 1985). Setting up a parent body from a school community may be helpful to drive changes but this requires permission from the school and /or P&C so if they are not "Gifted Friendly" then won't be allowed.
