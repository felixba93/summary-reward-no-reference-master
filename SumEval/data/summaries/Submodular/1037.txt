In a school where there are 28 children in Kindergarten, I don't expect the only learning my child will receive has to be in school, but I do expect that it would be hard to manage that number of children when some are emotionally young. Although you would think that it is a simple decision, with every child starting school once they reached a certain age, some parents decide to hold their kids back another year if they have a "late" birthday (one that is close to their school district's cut off date). I thought for sure she was ready for school and she was, academically.
