The survey also found that of the one in three children who awaken at least once a night needing help or attention, only eleven percent of those parents responded "yes" when asked if their child has a sleep problem. Other steps you can take to help with this process is to cut back on daytime sleeping and consider a later bedtime, since your child is less likely to protest or repeatedly wake up if she is very tired. The best way to deal with nightmares is to comfort the child who will often be distressed by them and check that they are not worried about any events during their day.
