A good resource for parents that includes important information on how children learn to read and write, tips on what you can do with babies and young children to help them become readers, ideas for books to read, and organizations to contact for more help or information. The term "school readiness," once denoting a child's ability to separate from her parents for a few hours without too much fuss and go to the bathroom by herself, now refers to her mastery of early numeracy and literacy skills. And with the right help, one day your children will feel that love of reading all on their own.
