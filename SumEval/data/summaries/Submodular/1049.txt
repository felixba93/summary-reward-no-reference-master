The point is that I can understand the distinction between Anthroposophy and it's "world view" or "belief system" or basic ideas and Waldorf Education as a work in itself, but obviously the WCs do not and refuse to do so when it is pointed out because it is more politically useful to use the more avante-garde bits from Steiner as a proof that Waldorf Teachers must be nuts! With this approach, the students and teachers come to know each other very well, and the teacher is able to find over the years the best ways of helping individual children in their schooling. "OK - what did we do last week?"
