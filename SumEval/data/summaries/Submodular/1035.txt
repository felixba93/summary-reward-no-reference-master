In kids, depression can appear as "bad moods" or irritability that persists for a long time, even if a child doesn't acknowledge being sad. I still love you, and I will make sure that if I can't take care of your needs, I will find another adult who can (be sure to be specific about what need and who will meet them). Disabled children are more likely to manage having their parents out of sight for awhile if they are with a familiar person they like. With older kids, say age 8 and up, talk about why you are going to do things differently and ask for their help in changing family eating patterns.
