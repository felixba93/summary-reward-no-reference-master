That's why it's so important not to decide who's right or wrong during a conflict, but to challenge your children to find a way to get along with each other. Postpone: If a friend or parent is in a "bad" mood, it might be a good idea for you to wait until tomorrow to talk to them about your problem, because they will not be able to think clearly right now. If parents are unable to make these decisions themselves because of conflict, family and child mediators and counsellors can help them to negotiate with each other. Their interests and skill levels are not the same.
