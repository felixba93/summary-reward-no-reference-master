Sometimes parents assume that their kids will figure out things on their own, but if you're dealing with a chronic issue, you have to face facts: your child has not figured it out by himself and he is not likely to do so. For someone just coming out of public school would he or she expect to go straight into their same grade in the virtual school or are the students placed in the appropriate level for each subject they take? I really have no clue how this age gap effects Uni students, but I assume they have an easier time than I did being that they are the minority instead of the exception.
