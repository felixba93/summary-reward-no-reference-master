And, as far as the use time for cellphones, we must consider the fact that parents often provide young children with cordless phones even when they do not allow these same children to have cellphones. If the child is so in charge of the family that the parents are "forced" to buy a cell phone to keep it happy, then there is far more wrong in that family than anything caused by a large corporation. Parents, for the most part, are glad of the technology because it gives them a quick and efficient means of contacting their children in the event of an emergency, whether at school or after hours.
