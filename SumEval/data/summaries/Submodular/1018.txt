If you apply for a private student loan on your own, without a cosigner, and are denied, it's probably because you have insufficient personal credit history, as is typical for a student. Nothing prevents parents from helping their children with the payments on their Stafford loans, and the lower interest rate will save money, so it is best to borrow the Stafford loan first. School channel loans are verified and directly disbursed to the school that the applicant is attending, where they are then applied against the student's tuition bill. 6% and a pupil is allowed to borrow more than $2000.
