I'd like my son to learn to navigate the computer, and have wondered if there are good quality, educational games or what- have-you that are good for a 2-3 year old. My experience with patients, and one of my own children, is that they tend to get hooked on the games and play so much that it can deteriorate their school work and social time. Explain this to your son's with emphasis on compassion for those parents and emphasis on how they are being prepared to help the world by making the best of what they came in and although they can take a little time off they have work to do.
