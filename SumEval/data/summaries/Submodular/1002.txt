And the reality is, depriving my children of their phones now would be akin to my parents cutting me off of our old landline back when I was a teenager, although even then we had limits, like no calls after 9 p. m. Rather, parents have to be on top of how that cellphone is being used. "i think a good age for a kid to get a cellphone is when they get into middle school or as a present for they're fifth grade graduation!" But it's as hard for that market - us parents - to find the apps we want for our kids as it is for the developers to find us. At almost one year, she still has it in good shape!"
