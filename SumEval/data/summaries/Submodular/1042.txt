We firmly believe that if the message of this report is accepted by schools and the changes in perspective and emphasis which we have advocated - particularly in relation to religious education, 'pastoral' concerns and language needs - are realised, then this will go a considerable way towards meeting the concerns of many ethnic minority parents about their children's education and that many of the particular concerns which have led sections of the Asian community to call for the establishment of their own schools would also be allayed. Why, they are asked, do you want to be different?
