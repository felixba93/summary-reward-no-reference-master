If you want to enroll your child in a Montessori school it is important that you learn what a Montessori school should be like, and then observe children working in the school you are considering. Our certified teachers have a combined 73 years of experience in the Montessori classroom and they are committed to each and every one of our students. Because unschooling does not spell out when and what needs to be learned, it can seem chaotic for a parent who is looking for more instruction and guidance on the precise ways to teach and keep order. My daughter attended for two years, from aged 3 to 5.
