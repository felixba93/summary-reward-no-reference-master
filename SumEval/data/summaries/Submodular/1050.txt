If you read my book, Raising a Gifted Child: A Parenting Success Handbook , you will see that my mission is to inform students, parents, and teachers about the many educational possibilities that are available to them so that they can make better choices in the future. She not only explains the strategies that might be used in the classroom to differentiate instruction, but also shows parents how they can enhance their children's learning at home and also support and get involved with student learning at school. There's no need for me to look for it or open it up when I want it.
