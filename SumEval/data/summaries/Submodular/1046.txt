What I would argue, is that there are many ways that parents and other community members can be involved in schools that actually enhance your experience for you, and help to remove the barriers often found between teenagers and adults. My opinion is twofold on the role construction of parents relationships with teachers and vice versa: Children of this age will not proactively encourage their parents to stay or become involved in their learning experiences and teachers do not want to develop relationships with the parents of their students. Be sure to provide child care for parents who need it.
