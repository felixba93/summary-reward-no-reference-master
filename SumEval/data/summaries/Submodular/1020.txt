It is outside the scope of this article to make recommendations on boarding schools and other residential solutions for serious behavioral problems in children , but certainly if you come to the decision that your child or teenager needs this type of intervention, it would be silly to send them off and not be taking serious parenting courses yourself at the same time. If you're unsure if an adolescent in your life is depressed or just "being a teenager," consider how long the symptoms have been present, how severe they are, and how different the teen is acting from his or her usual self.
