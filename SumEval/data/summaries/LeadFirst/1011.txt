I think there is an extraordinarily unbalanced perception in our society of how much socializing children need. 
They often point out that children - especially little ones - need far less socializing than is normally expected in this day and in this country (and probably most other Western countries as well). 
Yes, we are social beings, but our primary and most important arena for socializing is the home. 
Even then, home is the most important place - and should, in my experience, be the main arena of life until  about the 9 year change.
