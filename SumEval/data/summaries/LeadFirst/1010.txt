Homeschooling remains legal in California, and California homeschoolers will be filing their private school affidavits between October 1 and 15 as they have for years. 
They worked for months with the attorneys from HSC and CHEA, to defend our right to continue to homeschool legally in California. 
In Feburary 2008 this same court issued an opinion that held that California parents can homeschool their children only if they hold a valid teaching credential.
