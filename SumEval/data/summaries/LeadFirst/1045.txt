Discussing Concerns with Family Members I am concerned that my grandson may have signs of autism, but I am uncomfortable bringing this up with my son and daughter-in-law. 
Do you have any suggestions about how best to approach them? 
Answered by Peggy Halliday, MEd, BCBA (Virginia Institute of Autism) and David Celiberti, PhD, BCBA-D (President, Association for Science in Autism Treatment) It is natural to be unsure of how to share your concerns with your grandson's parents. 
As is the case with many concerned family members, you may worry that such a discussion may not be well received.
