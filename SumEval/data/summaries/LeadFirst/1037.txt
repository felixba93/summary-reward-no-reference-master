David would be 5 in July. 
Full of enthusiasm, he confidently underwent spring kindergarten screening. 
The school psychologist explained that David completed the screening with average and above-average skills, but he had a summer birthday and he was a male. 
The psychologist and the gym teacher agreed that David would be more successful in school if he were to postpone kindergarten for 1 year. 
David&#x92;s experience has been repeated over and over by many children across the country.
