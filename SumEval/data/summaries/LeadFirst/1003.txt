Illness &amp; disability Special education and mainstream classes If you have a disability that affects how you learn, you may be put in a mainstream class but be given extra attention to help you learn. 
Or, you may be put in a special education class with other kids who have disabilities. 
If you are in a mainstream class, it is because you, your parents, and your teachers have decided it's the best place for you to learn. 
Even so, you may need help with certain things. 
If something is out of your reach or you have a question about the assignment, don't be afraid to ask.
