Probably the best way to get rid of a phobia is to face your fear directly. 
Of course, you can't do that all at onceï¿½and you certainly can't do it by yourself. 
In cognitive-behavioral therapy, you meet for about 12 sessions (although social phobia may take more) with a trained mental health professional. 
He or she will ask you to confront whatever it is that you fear in a carefully planned way. 
First your mental health professional may ask you to see the object or situation in your imagination. 
Then he or she will ask you to look at pictures of what you fear.
