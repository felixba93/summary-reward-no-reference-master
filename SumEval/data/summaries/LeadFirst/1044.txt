One Term, Many Definitions: "Special Needs" is an umbrella underneath which a staggering array of diagnoses can be wedged. 
Children with special needs may have mild learning disabilities or profound cognitive impairment; food allergies or terminal illness; developmental delays that catch up quickly or remain entrenched; occasional panic attacks or serious psychiatric problems. 
The designation is useful for getting needed services, setting appropriate goals, and gaining understanding for a child and stressed family.
