Patsy and Edward Pastrano had no idea their bright, young son Gabe might have a learning disability until he entered second grade in his Montessori school and learning began to involve more and more abstract concepts. "He's very smart but he would learn something and then it was gone," Patsy Pastrano says. "He was also very distracted by other things in his environment." A teacher recommended that Gabe, then 8, be tested at the Children's Learning Institute (CLI) at The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston.
