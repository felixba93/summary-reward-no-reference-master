Corporal punishment is a discipline method in which a supervising adult deliberately inflicts pain upon a child in response to a child's unacceptable behavior and/or inappropriate language. 
The immediate aims of such punishment are usually to halt the offense, prevent its recurrence and set an example for others. 
The purported long-term goal is to change the child's behavior and to make it more consistent with the adult's expectations.
