In recognition of this growing problem, 41 states now have anti-bullying laws (www.bullypolice.org). 
Currently many anti-bullying bills are under consideration in the Massachusetts legislature*. 
These bills call for schoolwide strategies to address bullying and for school districts to formulate prevention and intervention policies and procedures for reporting and investigating bullying. 
For example, in the fall of 2009, responses to a Massachusetts Advocates for Children online survey asked about the extent of bullying against children on the autism spectrum.
