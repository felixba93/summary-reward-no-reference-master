When our oldest son was in elementary school, he suffered from a very hot temper that tended to get him in trouble both at home and at school. 
One afternoon in about fifth grade, he and another boy in our neighborhood got in a fight at lunch recess and was sent to the principal's office. 
The principal knew our son was a good student who just let his emotions get out of control from time to time. 
During their meeting, he learned that Spencer was an avid reader, and he introduced him to the books written by Louis L'Amour .
