Thank you for sharing your experience. 
Parents should certainly be held accountable for their actions but at the same time teachers need to deal with the realities in the classroom. 
It sounds like you are a teacher that parents should be grateful to have teacher their children. 
I totally agree with you.Its been like this since time itself. 
Stand tall or get your tail whipped all your life.Like you said you have to handle your own cause there isnt always going to be someone there to protect you.I learnt that when I was in school. 
Good point!! Bullying has been going on since time itself.
