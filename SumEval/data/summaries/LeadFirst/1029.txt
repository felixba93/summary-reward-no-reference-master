Parents are often very distressed about their son/daughter's drug use. 
They need their fears, anxieties and concerns to be fully heard. 
However, do not deepen problems. 
Rather look for opportunities to congratulate on their management of distress. 
Often only one parent will make the initial contact. 
Assess the other parent's involvement and point of view. 
If possible, have both parents present for further sessions.
