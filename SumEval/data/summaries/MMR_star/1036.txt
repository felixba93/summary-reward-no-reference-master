She is going to be talking to us about creating a case for your child and family in the school community. 
We have had no problems with teacher bullying or anything of that nature. 
They don't follow it at all as far as I can tell. 
And more kids than you may realize are very advanced. 
Consequently they do not learn social skills on their own. l faced this same decision when my daughter was 15. 
The opposite has been true. 
Shy children like Sarah suffer from an internal conflict called approach avoidance conflict . 
Could any Black Pine Circle parents out there help me out?
