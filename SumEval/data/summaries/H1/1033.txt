Families with high parental involvement in their children's schools are more likely to visit a library, museum or historical site with their children, and are more likely to have high educational expectations for their children.
Chrispeels and Rivero (2001) previously found that after participating in this education program, parents reported dramatic changes in their parenting behaviors, such as praising their child, engaging in less physical punishment for mistakes, and establishing rules and limits to television viewing, which supported more time for learning activities.
