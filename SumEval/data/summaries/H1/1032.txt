Parents who are unable to cope with their own stress and anxiety can often unknowingly trigger these disorders in their kids.
These are the children who spend their time anticipating the worst.
They may be in the shadow of children whose more disruptive difficulties claim the immediate attention of parents and teachers.
Even parents who never loved school may be baffled, embarrassed or frustrated by the child's behavior.
Obviously parents can't predict and prepare for everything, so teaching a child to be more flexible and think through changes will also help.
