International students are eligible to receive a private student loan as long as they have a US citizen or a permanent resident cosigns the loan.
Students are not required to make interest or principal payments until 6 months after graduation.
Students can defer their loan repayments and begin repaying the loan after graduation.
This means there's only one private student loan payment each month.
It is a long process and complicated phrase but really easy to understand.
Existing students will be sent an application form directly by their LEA.
