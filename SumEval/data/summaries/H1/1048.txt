Potty training is a skill to be taught.
Today's training pants are too absorbent and don't let the kids feel the wetness.
It is not unusual for younger children to have setbacks with potty training.
â€¢ Bear in mind that toilet-related fears are common - whether it's getting splashed, falling in, or not wanting to use "strange" toilets (with the definition of "strange" being completely in the eye of the potty beholder).
Take them to pick out their undies if possible and their rewards.
Bare bum, and going from diaper to underwear.
