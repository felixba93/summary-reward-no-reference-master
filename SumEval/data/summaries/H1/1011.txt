A parental right to educate one's children is a popular belief among homeschoolers (Benoit, 1997).
Homeschooling is an alternative method of teaching where the parent delivers an educational program to children at home.
A Utah mother of six assumed full responsibility for teaching her LD children to read.
Parents like that it tracks progress and helps children advance by clearly presenting and reinforcing each lesson.
Disorganized parents are also likely to have serious difficulties being in charge of an educational program.
All parents need is a basic education to be able to teach a child.
