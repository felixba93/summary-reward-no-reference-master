Include a section on cyber bullying in the student handbook.
- Make the consequences of cyber bullying very clear so students know what will happen if they act inappropriately.
Be sure to add a section that outlines the school's right to discipline a student for cyber bullying outside of school if the actions compromise the safety of the victim or have a negative effect on the victim at school.
- Make students aware that you know about cyber bullying and it will not be tolerated in your school.
Be sure to reference the "cyber bullying section" in the student handbook as well.
