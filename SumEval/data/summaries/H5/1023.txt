Many victims don't report it to their parents or teachers because they're embarrassed or humiliated by the bullying.
Such programs can concentrate on peers, bullies, curriculum, teachers, parents, or various combinations of these, although prevention programs are not always effective.
While this approach addresses the immediate bullying incident and the primary individuals involved, it ignores the impact of environmental factors such as the school's culture, peer and bystander influence, and family dynamics that can have a huge effect on bullying incidents.
