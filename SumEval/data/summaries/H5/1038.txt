Age is what schools have traditionally used as the deciding factor to determine a child's readiness for kindergarten.
While age does play an important role in kindergarten enrollment, both preschool and kindergarten teachers are also now looking at a variety of skills and behaviors to determine if a child is ready.
Kindergarten teachers recommend that before children start kindergarten, they attend a preschool or nursery school program for at least two half days a week.
Preschool teachers often have a pretty good idea of whether children are ready for kindergarten.
