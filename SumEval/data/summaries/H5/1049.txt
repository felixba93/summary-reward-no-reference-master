Children in a Waldorf school develop a strong sense of community because they spend eight years not only with the same classmates but also with the same teacher, who stays with the class and teaches all the main academic subjects from grades one through eight.
I can't remember any Moslems, but I have written an article called "Religion in the Waldorf Schools" which outlines why I think most fundamentalist Christian or Moslem parents would not choose a Waldorf School for their children.
