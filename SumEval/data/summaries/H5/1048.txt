Begin potty training when you are ready to devote the time and energy to encourage your child on a daily basis for at least three months.
When your child is ready, he will signal that his diaper is wet or soiled or will tell you that he would like to go to the potty.
Tell your child that the potty chair is his own chair.
Stay with your child when he is on the potty chair.
Place your child on the potty chair whenever he signals the need to go to the bathroom so he'll associate the potty with the urge to go.
