When kids seem moodier or more easily upset than usual, or when they start avoiding certain situations, like taking the bus to school, it might be because of a bully.
Let your kids know that if they're being bullied - or see it happening to someone else - it's important to talk to someone about it, whether it's you, another adult (a teacher, school counselor, or family friend), or a sibling.
In national surveys, most kids and teens say that bullying happens at school.
