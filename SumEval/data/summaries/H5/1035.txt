Types of depression include: major depression, dysthymia, adjustment disorder with depressed mood, seasonal affective disorder , and bipolar disorder or manic depression.
A child with major depression feels depressed almost every day.
In kids, depression can appear as "bad moods" or irritability that persists for a long time, even if a child doesn't acknowledge being sad.
Unlike major depression, dysthymia does not severely interfere with day-to-day functioning but the "down mood" is a pervasive part of the child's world.
