The ideal role of the teacher, implied in the review of conflict resolution programs, is to model and teach children the necessary skills to constructively manage their conflicts.
They neutralize their balance of power and reduce the likelihood for conflict to erupt in front of the children.
While the policy is focused on inappropriate behavior among children it can help minimize opportunities for conflict by ensuring that these sensitive issues are dealt with in a clear and appropriate way.
