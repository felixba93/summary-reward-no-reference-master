Many nursery school programs around the country now offer an additional year for children who are age-appropriate for kindergarten, but who are not developmentally ready.
And many independent schools have introduced a transitional or Pre-K year for children who are not ready for kindergarten.
Some experts believe that preschool may even be more important for kids who've been at home with their parents, to help get them ready for the move to kindergarten.
I strongly encourage you and your child to visit the school before school starts.
