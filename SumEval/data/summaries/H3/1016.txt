- If your child is sleep deprived because he or she regularly resists sleep, consider how your child views bedtime.
Have a relaxing bedtime routine that ends in the room where the child sleeps.
But when a toddler is waking up many times through the night, or a preschooler refuses to go to sleep at bedtime, parents don't know what to do.
Even when forced to go to bed earlier these children will not be sleepy and while they might stay in their room they will still not fall asleep until their later usual bedtime.
