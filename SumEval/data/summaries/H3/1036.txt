At the beginning of the school year, staff does not decide who is in which kindergarten classroom until each of the teachers have had a chance to teach all the children for one day.
Shy children in preschool often show signs of social anxiety during free play with peers.
If a parent is shy too, but functions normally in social settings, they will often think that their child's shyness is normal too.
But if the parents are very outgoing and are extroverts, they will more often see their child's shyness as a problem.
The teachers really pay attention to what each child needs.
