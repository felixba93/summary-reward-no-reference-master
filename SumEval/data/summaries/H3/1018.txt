Federal loans are approved based on a variety of factors, like financial need, but not on credit history or lack of one; this means that a student with weak or no credit history can receive federal loans.
Here are the names of some of the most common federal student loans not requiring credit check: Stafford loans, Perkin loans, and Grad Plus loans.
The federal Graduate PLUS loan is approved based off of credit history; however, these loans generally have a less-stringent credit review than private, non-federal loans.
