There is some evidence that if a child receives cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in a group setting, it can help prevent or delay the onset of depression in a child or teen whose parent has depression (which puts the child at greater risk for becoming depressed).
Their intervention strategy focuses on increasing children's resilience to depression, especially with children who may be at high risk for developing the disorder (i.e., children of depressed parents).
Antidepressants are often used due to their success in adults or due to studies in the pediatric population.
