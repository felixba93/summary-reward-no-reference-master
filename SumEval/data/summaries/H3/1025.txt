Student bullying is one of the most frequently reported discipline problems at school: 21% of elementary schools, 43% of middle schools, and 22% of high schools reported problems with bullying in 2005-06.
Cyber bullies may use the internet to send intimidating and threatening emails to others, create hostile Web sites, post inaccurate and embarrassing information in blogs, ignore kids who send them messages, and pose as people other than themselves in chat rooms.
Cyber-bullying is similar to other types of bullying, except it takes place online or through text messages sent to cell phones.
