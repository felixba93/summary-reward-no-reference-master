Adults teach the child or adolescent new ways of behaving by changing the ways they themselves respond to the child's or teen's behaviors.
Educate yourself on parenting - especially on parenting problem teenagers.
If you aren't sure what to do or say in these moments you are trying to handle a disrespectful teenager, use a clear parenting resource to help you.
Depending upon your personal family situation, a parenting mentor is also an excellent idea for folks who are parenting troubled teenagers.
