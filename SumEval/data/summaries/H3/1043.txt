Reach Out and Read (ROR) promotes early literacy by giving new books to children and advice to parents about the importance of reading aloud in pediatric exam rooms across the nation.
Children take their first critical steps toward learning to read and write very early in life.
A Developmental Path to Reading from The ERIC Review is available for download to help parents and teachers take steps to ensure children will make the transition from learning to read to reading to learn by the end of third grade.
