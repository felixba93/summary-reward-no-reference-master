Gordon's six types of parent involvement (Gordon & Breivogel, 1976) are: (a) the traditional type of parent involvement type (the parent as audience or bystander-observer); (b) parents as decision makers (as in School Advisory Committees or Parent Teacher Associations [PTAs] in which parents participate in school decision making activities); (c) parents begin as classroom volunteers; (d) parent as a paid paraprofessional or teacher's aide; (e) parents as learners (e.g., participate in child development or parenting classes); and (f) parents as teachers of their own children at home.
