Bullying can make a child feel helpless.
"The key components of the bullying intervention program, according to Olweus, are increased adult supervision in all areas of the school, increased consequences for bullying behavior, and a clear message that bullying will not be tolerated."
* Children in schools participating in the anti-violence/bullying intervention over time appeared to engage in less aggressive bystanding (i.e., encouraging bullying) and to be more likely to help victims of bullies, compared to children in other schools studied.
