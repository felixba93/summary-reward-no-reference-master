Some people think diet supplements improve symptoms of ADHD.
The use of these supplements as treatment for ADHD is based on theories that ADHD symptoms are caused by the lack of certain nutrients and minerals in the body.
Iron levels tend to be low in individuals with ADHD.
However, there is little evidence that a diet without sugar or additives help with the symptoms of ADHD.
Others proponents of dietary manipulations as alternative treatments for ADHD postulated that dietary sugar and simple carbohydrates could cause ADHD in children.
