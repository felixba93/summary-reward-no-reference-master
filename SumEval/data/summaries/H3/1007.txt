Ericksonian hypnosis and Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) techniques work more effectively than conventional hypnosis programs because they are not phobia specific; they can be used to cure any phobia, or even multiple phobias.
The techniques found in Ericksonian hypnosis and NLP are especially effective at curing phobias because they operate at the unconscious level of the mind.
People who experience "Social Phobia, Social Anxiety" become very anxious when facing certain social situations.
Understanding fear can alleviate it.
My osteopath suggested hypnotherapy, recommending a therapist.
