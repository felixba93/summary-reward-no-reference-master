Some schools seek to incorporate parents' wisdom and experience into the academic content of the school curriculum Â— in ways that don't require the parents to come to school.
Parents believe that the schools need to strengthen practices such as giving parents specific information on their children's major academic subjects and what their children are expected to learn each year.
Schools must be open to the involvement of parents in the work they do and they should consider ways of providing information that helps parents engage with school and their children's education.
