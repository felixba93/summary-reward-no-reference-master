If in undies, they dump their poop into toilet (don't let them flush if they like flushing) and take off undies.
You should get rid of the diapers and keep him in underwear.
Never ask if they need to go but say "tell me when you need to use potty" or "it's time to use the potty."
You'll also want to have supplies for cleaning up accidents (such as rags, cleaning solution, and a plastic bucket) and several pairs of loose-fitting pants for your child to wear when you go out of the house.
