I have an 8 year old daughter.
Just keep in mind that discipline has to do with teaching, not punishment.
I want to be positive, not yell at her, or spank her cause it breaks my heart when she is in trouble.
My 5- yo son is very aggressive, both physically and verbally.
Many parenting experts say that children are happier and more secure when they know clearly where the rules and boundaries are.
Open communication with your child about what goes on at school and in their world is the key to raising a responsible, caring teen.
Understand why your child is acting the way he or she is.
