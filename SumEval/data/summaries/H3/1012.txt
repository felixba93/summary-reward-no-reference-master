Surely this is tantamount to these homeschoolers saying that homeschooling doesn't work -- just what the anti-homeschool people need to turn the system back against homeschooling!
Many of us were homeschooling our children until Wildcat opened and it has been an ideal middle ground between homeschooling and school.
I believe that home schooling has shown that students gain more autonomy in a home schooled setting.
The flip side of homeschooling is the possibility of the parent/parents injecting far more prejudice and political attitudes than would be found in a classroom.
