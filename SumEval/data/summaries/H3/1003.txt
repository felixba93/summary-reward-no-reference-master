Bullying can make kids not want to play outside or go to school.
For example, if your child is being bullied, you will need to work with the school to make sure your child is protected and that it stops.
As both parent and teacher, I agree with one of the main points, that of finding out what the main problem is behind the negative behaviors, but I disagree that there should be no further consequence at home for poor choices kids make at school.
You may also feel judged-and blamed-by teachers and other parents for what your child does at school.
