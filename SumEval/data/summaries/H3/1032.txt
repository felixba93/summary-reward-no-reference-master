Anxiety symptoms are actually results of anxiety disorders and these anxiety symptoms can only be treated if the anxiety disorder it comes with is treated as well.
Some people are also asked to see a therapist about their anxiety problems to help them get to the root of what is really causing the anxiety symptoms they are feeling.
When the anxiety experienced by a young person starts to affect their general functioning, they may not just be feeling stressed - they may be suffering from an anxiety disorder.
