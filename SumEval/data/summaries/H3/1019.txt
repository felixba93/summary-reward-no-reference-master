Within-case and cross-case analysis of data are selected as analysis techniques.
Cross-case analysis divides the data by type across all cases investigated.
Those techniques that can confirm a technique in the field using industry data (e.g., case study, legacy data, field study) dominate the rankings, while "artificial" environments (e.g., theoretical analysis, synthetic study) are at the bottom.
Researchers could use the case study method to further study the role of the librarian in implementing specific models of service.
