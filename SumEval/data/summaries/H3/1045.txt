You need to foster an environment supportive of protecting your child from the risks associated with using a mobile phone and as the one usually paying the bill you should set boundaries on your child's cellphone use.
Many parents (mostly those with children older than your daughter) use cell phones as a small-scale introduction to adult responsibilitiesâ€"everything from paying the bill and staying within monthly minutes to keeping it charged.
You may opt for a family cellphone plan in which you have one bill but your teen pays for his portion.
