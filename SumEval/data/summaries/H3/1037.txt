Many nursery school programs around the country now offer an additional year for children who are age-appropriate for kindergarten, but who are not developmentally ready.
While kindergarten teachers commonly report that younger kids struggle their first year, research has also shown that "by third grade, there is no measurable academic advantage to delayed entry" and that "children who entered school relatively young did not appear to be disadvantaged academically in the long-run."
To be eligible for 4-year-old kindergarten, a child must be 4 by September 1 of the school year.
