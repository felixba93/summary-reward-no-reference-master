Quality early childhood settings use ongoing assessments and systematic evaluations to gather information on children's learning and development and the quality of the program.
Early Learning for Every Child Today is prepared for use by early childhood practitioners - early childhood educators, parenting workers, kindergarten teachers, family support staff, early interventionists, home care visitors - and other caregivers who are working in early childhood settings.
