This section discusses the use of school discipline policies, student conduct rules or school codes of behaviour.
All students, parents, and school personnel should be aware of the school's discipline policy or student conduct code.
While corporal punishment such as paddling, spanking and hitting students disappeared from private schools by the 1960s, it is still permitted in public schools in 20 states.
Shockingly, in twenty states, corporal punishment is still a legal and accepted form of discipline by teachers and school administrators.
