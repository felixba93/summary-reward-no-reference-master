If you're on the outside of a clique and you want to be friends with someone who's in it, invite that person to do something with you. But it's better for everyone if homeschooling isn't chosen just as an escape from school or problems there, such as bullying . You can�t say, "I understand he has difficulty reading, but I will not tolerate his continually losing his homework." It can really help to have at least one other peer, or friend, who is willing to say "no," too. The kids would likely egg him on. Modify your methods. Don�t take it personally.
