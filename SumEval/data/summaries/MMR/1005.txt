Sometimes I have to remind myself of this and have a little meeting with her to set down my expectations and what the consequences will be for breaches. You are right on track when you mention that your children are spoiled. This is common but not long-lasting. The thing is, lately she has started putting herself in time-out. She does it at school, other places. They were never even yelled more than once or twice. Why would kids follow someone they don't respect?" What can we do? My (almost) seven year old was really getting rude. It makes me so nervous.
