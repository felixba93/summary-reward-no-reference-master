If your teenager misbehaves, you may be less likely to overreact and believe that the behavior is a sign of laziness, intentional defiance, or budding delinquency. You're not stuck with them-they are not set in stone. Getting help for troubled teenagers can mean looking at multiple solutions. Well, I will tell you: They do what they do because they want to! However, other students have more difficulty. The carrot-and-stick approach works on teens too. Or worrying about their school performance? As this comparison shows, WRA Teen Boot Camp sees problems as normal.
