Teachers should have the authority to take the cellphone and hold it for a period of time (punishment) if a student is found to use it in the class, the parents should be called and informed. Sometimes, they send phones with kids as young as 10 years old. They are always having sales on their units. His mom, Elizabeth Gonzales, likes knowing that he can call home at any time. "i got my 1st phone when i was 12. The teachers just don't know it." But it's not without headaches. Back then, I wasn't worried about inappropriate downloads. "I want one too, gettin' one this Christmas & I'm 12:)"
